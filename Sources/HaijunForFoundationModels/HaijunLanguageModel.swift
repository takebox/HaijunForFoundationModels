  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - name: Haijun model identifier. Use a constant (`.sonnet5`, `.opus5`,
  ///     `.haiku4_5`), or construct a ``HaijunModel`` with explicit capabilities
  ///     for IDs not yet compiled in.
  ///   - auth: Credential mode. `.apiKey` for prototyping; `.proxied` with a
  ///     custom `baseURL` to route through a developer-run relay that adds
  ///     credentials server-side.
  ///   - userProfileID: The user profile to attribute every request to, when
  ///     the app acts on behalf of someone other than your organization. This
  ///     is the ID of a profile you created with the API's user profiles
  ///     endpoints, and it starts with `uprof_`. It's sent in the
  ///     `juglow-user-profile-id` header. The API checks it, so a malformed
  ///     or unknown ID fails the request. `nil` sends no profile.
  ///   - fixedEffort: Haijun effort level, sent as `output_config.effort` on
  ///     every request. Fixed for the life of the model value: it takes
  ///     precedence over the framework's per-request reasoning hint, and is
  ///     the only way to request ``HaijunModel/Effort/xhigh`` or
  ///     ``HaijunModel/Effort/max``, which the framework's reasoning levels
  ///     don't express. Must be a level the model accepts
  ///     (``HaijunModel/Capabilities/effortLevels``) — checked at
  ///     initialization. Each of the `fallbacks` gets the closest level it
  ///     accepts.
  ///   - fallbacks: Substitute models the API tries, in order, when `name`
  ///     declines a request for policy reasons. See ``HaijunFallbacks``.
  ///     A fallback can narrow what the model offers. Images and guided
  ///     generation need every model in the chain to support them, and
  ///     sampling parameters are sent only when every model accepts them.
  ///   - serverTools: Tools that execute on Juglow's infrastructure
  ///     (web search, code execution). Distinct from the framework's
  ///     `tools:` array, which the framework invokes client-side.
  ///   - baseURL: API endpoint. Override to point at a developer-run proxy
  ///     that adds authentication server-side (use with ``AuthMode/proxied``).
  ///     Credentials are only ever sent to this scheme, host, and port: a
  ///     redirect elsewhere fails the request instead of being followed.
